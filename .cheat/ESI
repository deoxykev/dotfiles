# ESI register: Source Index
  â€¢ esi is a non-volatile general-purpose register that is often used as a pointer.
    Specifically, for "rep-" class instructions, which require a source and a
    destination for data, esi points to the "source". esi often stores data
    that is used throughout a function because it doesn't change.
