======================================
OSI MODEL:
======================================
Upper Layers
Layers 7 through 4 comprise the upper layers of the OSI protocol stack. They are more
geared to the type of application than the lower layers, which are designed to move
packets, no matter what they contain, from one place to another.
 
Application Layer 7
This top layer defines the language and syntax that programs use to communicate with
other programs. The application layer represents the purpose of communicating in
the first place. For example, a program in a client workstation uses commands to
request data from a program in the server. Common functions at this layer are
opening, closing, reading and writing files, transferring files and e-mail
messages, executing remote jobs and obtaining directory information about network
resources.
 
Presentation Layer 6
When data are transmitted between different types of computer systems, the
presentation layer negotiates and manages the way data are represented and encoded.
For example, it provides a common denominator between ASCII and EBCDIC machines as
well as between different floating point and binary formats. Sun's XDR and OSI's
ASN.1 are two protocols used for this purpose. This layer is also used for
encryption and decryption.
 
Session Layer 5
Provides coordination of the communications in an orderly manner. It determines
one-way or two-way communications and manages the dialog between both parties; for
example, making sure that the previous request has been fulfilled before the next
one is sent. It also marks significant parts of the transmitted data with
checkpoints to allow for fast recovery in the event of a connection failure.
In practice, this layer is often not used or services within this layer are sometimes
incorporated into the transport layer.
 
Transport Layer 4
This layer is responsible for overall end-to-end validity and integrity of the
transmission. The lower layers may drop packets, but the transport layer performs a
sequence check on the data and ensures that if a 12MB file is sent, the full 12MB
is received.
"OSI transport services" include layers 1 through 4, collectively responsible for
delivering a complete message or file from sending to receiving station without
error.
 
Lower Layers
Layers 3 through 1 are responsible for moving packets from the sending station to the
receiving station.
 
Network Layer 3
The network layer establishes the route between the sender and receiver across
switching points, which are typically routers. The most ubiquitous example of this
layer is the IP protocol in TCP/IP (see TCP/IP). IPX, SNA and AppleTalk are other
examples of routable protocols, which means that they include a network address and
a station address in their addressing system. This layer is also the switching
function of the dial-up telephone system. If all stations are contained within a
single network segment, then the routing capability in this layer is not required.
See layer 3 switch.
 
Data Link Layer 2
The data link is responsible for node to node validity and integrity of the
transmission. The transmitted bits are divided into frames; for example, an
Ethernet, Token Ring or FDDI frame in local area networks (LANs). Frame relay and
ATM are also at Layer 2. Layers 1 and 2 are required for every type of
communications. For more on this layer, see data link protocol.
 
Physical Layer 1
The physical layer is responsible for passing bits onto and receiving them from the
connecting medium. This layer has no understanding of the meaning of the bits, but
deals with the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the signals and
signaling methods. For example, it comprises the RTS and CTS signals in an RS-232
environment, as well as TDM and FDM techniques for multiplexing data on a line.
SONET also provides layer 1 capability.
