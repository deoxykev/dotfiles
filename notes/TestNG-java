c_TestNG: what is testng? • it's a java framework that simplifies testing. It can be used for unit and integration testing.
c_TestNG: pros cons advantages? • You can execute tasks in parallel, define task dependencies, organize & group tasks logically, and validate tests with sample data, report
c_TestNG: anotations? • @Before Test, @AfterTest, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite, @BeforeGroups ,@AfterGroups, @Test
c_TestNG: xml tag order?  • <suite>, <test>, <classes>, <class>, <methods>
c_TestNG: importance of testng.xml? • you choose which tests to run, pass in test parameters, add group dependencies, prioritize cases, configure parallelization
c_TestNG: how to pass in parameters? • @Parameters(<param>)
c_TestNG: assertions order? • assertEquals(), assertTrue(), assertFalse()
c_TestNG: soft assertion? • doesn't throw exception and test will continue on failure to next step
c_TestNG: hard assertion • test will fail and jump to the next @Test tag
c_TestNG: exception test • You can determine whether a code throws the expected exception or not.
c_TestNG: set test case priority? • @Test(priority=0) 
c_TestNG: parameterized testing? • you can run the test multiple times with different sets of data passed into the test 
c_TestNG: data driven testing? • @DataProvider(name="getData")
c_TestNG: How to group tests? • in testng.xml, under <test> or <suite> tag
c_TestNG: How to nest groups within groups? • called metagroups, <include name="groupOne"> inside <groups> tags
c_TestNG: How to run parallel test? • <suite name="softwaretestingmaterial" parallel="methods"> tests == all <test> parallel, classes = java parallel, methods = all @Test
c_TestNG: How to exclude test? • <exclude name="testMethodToExclude">
c_TestNG: How to disable test? enable test • @Test(enabled = false)
c_TestNG: How to skip a @Test method from exec? • throw new SkipException("Msg goes here")
c_TestNG: How to state dependencies? • dependsOnMethods attribute in @Test annotations, dependsOnGroup
c_TestNG: Ways to produce report? • Listener = real time notif, Reporter = reports after everything is done
c_TestNG: What is listener class? • configure reports and logging
c_TestNG: How to write regex? • <include name=".*test"> inside <method> tag
c_TestNG: What is time unit? • milliseconds (ms)
c_TestNG: What is use of @Test(invocationCount=x)? • How many times method should run
c_TestNG: What is the use of @Test(threadPoolSize=x)? • tells the computer to form a thread pool (to run multiple threads for the test)
c_TestNG: What is @Factory? • exec all tests in class with different set of data

c_UnitTest: what is unit testing? • A: testing individual bits of code
c_IntegrationTest: what is integration test? • A: testing if the pieces of the code work together

c_sel: what is automation testing? • find defects, ensure development quality with regression tests
c_sel: pros point of benefits? • time/money, efficient test, test multiple platforms, reliable, regression tests, maximum coverage
c_sel: cons limitations challenges • test only browser, no mobile, no native reporting, no dynamic elements, pop-up windows, captcha, page load wonkyness
c_sel: what type of tests have you automated? • regression, smoke testing, sanity testing, end-to-end testing
c_sel: how many test cases per day? • 2-5, depends on complexity
c_sel: what is framework? • rules/best practices (data driven, keyword driven, hybrid testing)
c_sel: describe framework you use • Page Object Model: class for every page. ;
