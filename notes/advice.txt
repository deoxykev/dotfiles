Currently going to school for CS degree. 3 years until graduation. I lucked into a job interview for a large cybersecurity firm and they offered 70k for a full time SOC analyst position for a 15x5 MSSP.  I still want to finish my CS degree, but it'll take 6 years at this rate if I go to school part time. 
My worry is managing the fatigue of work + study (CS is HARD) while giving up on my social life. There's untold value in building a network of colleagues at school while you still have loads of unstructured free time. I'd miss out on that. On the other hand, I don't have any real commitments in my life right now. Just car insurance and gas. Living with 8 roommates so rent is dirt cheap too-- this might be a great opportunity to save up money and graduate debt free. Luckily the commute from school -> work -> home is less than 10 minutes each, so I also have logistics in my favor.
On the other hand, I'm a rather lousy academic student-- I spend too much time hacking around on my homelab than studying for school and am generally undisciplined and highly prone to procrastination. While I'm taking steps to counter my natural tendencies, I don't know if I'll have enough mental fortitude to take on both. I just moved to a new state alone, so it's not like I have an extensive emotional support network to lean on or anything. It could be the case that if I accept this job and start working, I'll be unlikely to finish my degree and dropout prematurely. It could also be the case that the job will improve my time management skills enough that I could handle both. In any case, I still want that CS degree so I can get into work that's more interesting than policy management and firewall configuration. 
It's not like this is a super killer job opportunity either. I'm confident something similar or better will be available after I graduate. On the other hand, it's pretty relevant to what I want to end up working in (vuln research).
