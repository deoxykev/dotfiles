# ZONE TRANSFER
master server will give slave nameservers it's zone info. this is called zone transfer.
Usually it will only give the zone file to nameserver subdomains, but if not configured right will give that info to anybody.
Zone Transfer (AXFR): enumeration, leaks info about subdomains if improperly configured
